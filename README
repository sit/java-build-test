This is a simple project to test whether or not
various Java build tools can successfully do an
incremental build and detect breakages.

It runs two tests.  For each test, we start
with a clean build, then make a simple change and
see if the build output is correct.

1. Rename B.java to C.java and test whether B.class
   appears in the .jar file.  It should not.

2. Delete A.java which should break the build (because
   TestA.java instantiates an A).

From any Unix machine with Java, Maven, Gradle
and Buildr installed, just type "./runme.sh" to
run the tests.

Log files for each action in detail will appear
in the working directory.

As of Maven 3.0, Gradle 0.9.3, and Buildr 1.4.4, only
Gradle behaves correctly.
